Not entirely sure what this "read me" is for so forgive me for using this. It looks like a canvas but no code works here.

This project was simply designed to show others that I do actually understand code and can learn new aspects of what ever coding language. Right now my strong suits are HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT and each language has it's own snytax. I hope to build more pages and projects 
VERY SOON.
